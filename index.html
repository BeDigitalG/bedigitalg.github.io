				BeDigitalG is a continuous series of conferences, (weekly) evening talks, workshops and hackathons. Speakers and coaches should be digital champions (from in or outside of government). This is also an opportunity for startups to get more involved with government and for bigger companies to follow new trends.
			</p>
			<p>
				BeDigitalG will focus on digital skills in order to achieve interdisciplinar improvements regarding operational efficiency and open data.

						Concepts such as Open Data and Public Service Information (PSI) will become very important in the years to come. Not only because it will mandated from the European governance levels, but also because citizens will demand easy access to those data.
